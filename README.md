# Object-Detection-with-Python-and-OpenCV
This project applies object detection algorithms to identify and locate spark plugs in images or video frames. It demonstrates how computer vision can be used to automate inspection tasks in automotive or mechanical contexts. The notebook uses Python-based tools to process image data, apply detection models, and visualize the results.
This demonstrates how to detect spark plugs in images using object detection methods. It’s designed to automate part inspection tasks using computer vision, which can be valuable in automotive maintenance, manufacturing, and quality control workflows.

The notebook uses Python along with OpenCV and deep learning libraries to process image data, detect objects, and visualize the results. It runs seamlessly on Google Colab for ease of use and zero setup.
