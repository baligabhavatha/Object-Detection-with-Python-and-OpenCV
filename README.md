# Object-Detection-with-Python-and-OpenCV
This project applies object detection algorithms to identify and locate spark plugs in images or video frames. It demonstrates how computer vision can be used to automate inspection tasks in automotive or mechanical contexts. The notebook uses Python-based tools to process image data, apply detection models, and visualize the results.
